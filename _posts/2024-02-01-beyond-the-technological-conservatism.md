# Beyond the technological conservatism in Nowadays Software Engineering

## Understanding the Conservative Perspective: A Deeper Dive

The conservative perspective in software engineering, often perceived as a reluctance to embrace new technologies, is more than just a preference for the old over the new. It is a mindset steeped in prudence, caution, and a deep-rooted understanding of the risks associated with unproven technologies. To appreciate this viewpoint fully, one must delve into the reasons behind this cautious approach and recognize its value in a field as dynamic and risk-prone as software engineering.

The conservative outlook has been shaped significantly by historical lessons. The tech industry has seen numerous instances where technologies, initially touted as revolutionary, failed to deliver on their promises or introduced unforeseen complexities. Examples abound, from the dot-com bubble's overreliance on speculative technologies to the more recent disillusionment with certain aspects of blockchain technology. These lessons have instilled a sense of caution in experienced software engineers, emphasizing the importance of thorough vetting before adopting new tools or methodologies.

This historical context is crucial in understanding why many seasoned professionals prefer tried-and-tested technologies over emerging ones. Articles like [“Hype Driven Development”](https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22) not only caution against the perils of blindly following trends but also highlight the importance of stability, reliability, and maintainability — qualities often found in more established technologies.

At the core of the conservative approach is the value placed on stability and predictability. In the world of software engineering, where the cost of failure can be high, both in terms of resources and reputation, opting for technologies with a proven track record is a rational choice. For instance, established programming languages like Java or C# have extensive documentation, widespread community support, and a history of reliable performance, making them a safe choice for critical enterprise applications.

Moreover, this conservative stance is not just about avoiding risk. It’s also about ensuring that the technology stack is maintainable and supportable in the long run. Adopting the latest framework or language without considering its long-term viability can lead to significant challenges in maintaining and updating software systems as they age.

Skepticism, a key component of the conservative mindset, plays a vital role in the process of innovation. It encourages rigorous testing, thorough analysis, and critical thinking, ensuring that new technologies are not just exciting but also viable and beneficial in the long term. This skepticism is not about resisting change; rather, it's about demanding evidence of value and utility.

The insistence on evidence-based adoption often masks a deeper issue in the tech world: a fear of embracing new technologies. This caution, while seemingly prudent, can actually stifle innovation. It creates a culture where the potential of new technologies is not fully explored due to an overemphasis on their limitations and risks, rather than their strengths and applicability. In this environment, the iterative testing, refining, and validating of innovations, which are crucial to the development and maturation of new technological solutions, are hindered. Instead of fostering a dynamic and robust technological landscape, this fear-driven conservatism contributes to stagnation, where the safe and familiar are favored over the innovative and potentially transformative.

## Identifying Truly Transformative Technologies: A Closer Look

In the rapidly shifting terrain of software engineering, identifying technologies that offer genuine transformation amidst a sea of overhyped options is a critical skill. This task is not just about recognizing the potential in new tools but also understanding their practical application and long-term impact. Let’s delve deeper into why technologies like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and certain architectural styles stand out as transformative, rather than mere passing trends.

### Apache Spark: Revolutionizing Data Processing

Apache Spark exemplifies a transformative technology with its impact on big data processing. It’s not just another tool in the big data arsenal; it represents a significant leap forward. Spark’s in-memory data processing capabilities, which dramatically accelerate analytical and computational tasks, are a game-changer for data-intensive applications. This advancement is crucial in an era where data volume, velocity, and variety are continuously escalating.

The real power of Spark, however, lies in its versatility and ease of use, as detailed in “[Apache Spark: The New Enterprise Backbone for ETL, Batch, and Real-Time Processing](https://www.datanami.com/2018/05/23/apache-spark-the-new-enterprise-backbone-for-etl-batch-and-real-time-processing/)”. Unlike its predecessors, Spark offers a unified framework for a variety of data processing tasks – from batch processing to stream processing and machine learning, all within the same engine. This unification simplifies the data processing pipeline, reducing the complexity and resource requirements of managing multiple tools.

### Apache Kafka: A New Paradigm for Data Streaming

Similarly, Apache Kafka has redefined the landscape of real-time data streaming and processing. Kafka isn’t just another messaging system; it’s a robust, distributed streaming platform that has become almost synonymous with handling high-throughput, fault-tolerant data pipelines. Kafka’s design principles, which prioritize durability, scalability, and reliability, make it a cornerstone technology in modern data architecture.

As illustrated in “[The Rise of Apache Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/blog/the-rise-of-apache-kafka/)”, Kafka’s ability to handle real-time data feeds is critical in an age where instant data processing and analytics are not just desired but expected. Kafka’s unique approach to data streaming, which includes capabilities like log compaction and stream processing, provides organizations with the tools to build more dynamic, responsive, and data-driven applications.

### Architectural Styles: Adapting to Modern Challenges

When it comes to architectural styles, Microservices and Event Sourcing are not just buzzwords; they represent adaptive responses to modern software development challenges. Microservices, as extensively discussed in “[Microservices: A Definition of This New Architectural Term](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)” by Martin Fowler, offers a solution to the monolith’s rigidity. By decomposing applications into smaller, independently deployable services, microservices architecture enhances scalability, agility, and maintainability – key attributes in today’s fast-paced development cycles.

Event Sourcing, explored in depth in “[Event Sourcing Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)”, offers a novel approach to managing complex data systems. It’s not just an alternative technique for data storage and retrieval; it provides a fundamentally different way of thinking about data changes and state management. This is particularly valuable in systems where audit trails, historical data analysis, and complex transaction management are crucial.

### Expanded Perspective

Understanding what makes these technologies transformative requires a deep dive into their core principles and practical applications. It’s about seeing beyond the initial excitement and evaluating their long-term implications, scalability, and impact on the software development lifecycle. This involves not only reading about these technologies but also experimenting with them, understanding their use cases, and recognizing where they fit best in the technology landscape.

By identifying and embracing truly transformative technologies, we equip ourselves with tools that do not merely add complexity or follow trends but offer tangible improvements in efficiency, scalability, and performance. This discernment is key in evolving our practices and solutions in a manner that genuinely advances the field of software engineering.
