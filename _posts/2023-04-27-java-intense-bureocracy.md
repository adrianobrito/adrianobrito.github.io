Java is undoubtedly one of the most popular programming languages used today. While Java is widely loved for its simplicity, cross-platform compatibility, and robustness, the Java ecosystem is often criticized for its intense bureaucracy. The tools and frameworks built around Java, such as Spring, can add to this bureaucracy, making it difficult for developers to get started and achieve their goals.

[The intense bureaucracy of Java](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1463868) and its tools can be seen in several areas. For example, Java has a very verbose syntax, which requires a lot of boilerplate code to get started. This can be seen in the simple task of creating a new object. In Java, you must first declare the class, then define a constructor, then create a new instance of the class. This process can be time-consuming and confusing for beginners.

Comparing Java platform to other popular programming languages and frameworks, such as Python and Node.js, highlights some of the key differences in the level of bureaucracy involved. Python, for example, has a much simpler syntax than Java, making it easier for developers to get started and write code quickly. The Python ecosystem also has fewer dependencies, making it easier to manage and update libraries and packages. Node.js, on the other hand, is known for its fast and effiecient builds, which is far from being a reality in JVM based applications.

_Java is a suicidal platform_

When it comes to compare Spring(easily the most popular Java framework) to other popular frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails and Django, also highlights some of the key differences in the level of bureaucracy involved. Ruby on Rails, for example, is known for its "convention over configuration" approach, which reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to get started. Similarly, Django is known for its simplicity and ease of use, with a focus on building web applications quickly and efficiently.

Sure, Spring is known for its extensive documentation and support, but it can be difficult to learn and use effectively. It requires a lot of configuration and setup, and there are many different modules and components to understand. Also, Spring mantainers and users are very opinionated, which can make it challenging to integrate with other Java tools and frameworks.

Spring and "The Java" ecosystem are also often criticized for [its over-engineering culture](https://blog.frankel.ch/are-you-guilty-of-overengineering/). A culture that is characterized by the excessive usage of unnecessary design patterns and complex tools, which can make applications needlessly complicated and difficult to maintain. It's so funny to observe most of Java developers feeling pressured to use design patterns in their code, even when they are not necessary.

We can observe this in most of use cases that people relies in Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform that is often used for real-time data processing. While Kafka can be useful in certain situations, it can also add unnecessary complexity to Java applications. Developers may feel compelled to use Kafka, even when simpler solutions would suffice, leading to bloated and convoluted code. This is extremaly commmon specifically among Java developers, which is weird.

While design patterns and complex tools can be useful in certain situations, they should be used judiciously to avoid low quality code. Developers should focus on building simple and maintainable code, rather than succumbing to the pressures of the over-engineering culture and the usual bureocracy of Java Plataform.
