Code review is an essential part of the software development process. It is a practice that involves reviewing code changes made by developers to ensure that they meet certain standards, including functionality, readability, and maintainability. However, in some cases, code review sessions can become counterproductive and even harmful to the development process. This is when code reviews become "weaponized."

Weaponized code review is a practice where some individuals act as blockers during code review sessions. Instead of providing constructive feedback to help improve the code, they intentionally find issues and criticize the code changes made by others, ultimately creating a stressful and unproductive environment for all parties involved.

Weaponized code review is harmful for several reasons. Firstly, it creates a negative and hostile work environment, which can lead to burnout, disengagement, and ultimately, talent loss. Secondly, it slows down the development process as code changes get stuck in review and prevent progress. Thirdly, it can damage team morale and ultimately affect the quality of the final product.

Moreover, it is essential to remember that code review should not be about the reviewer's satisfaction alone. Code review is a collaborative process designed to improve code quality and ensure that the code meets established standards. When reviewers prioritize their satisfaction over the quality of the code, they can easily turn a productive session into a destructive one.

To avoid weaponized code reviews, it is essential to adopt a few strategies. Firstly, encourage a culture of constructive feedback. Ensure that all team members understand that code review is not a place to criticize individuals but a platform to improve the code's quality. Secondly, establish clear review standards and ensure that everyone understands them. Clear standards help to align expectations and avoid confusion during code review sessions.

Thirdly, establish clear processes to resolve disagreements. When disagreements arise during code reviews, establish processes to resolve them quickly and efficiently. This helps to avoid prolonging the review process and prevents tensions from escalating.

Fourthly, recognize and appreciate the efforts of the team members involved in the code review process. Positive reinforcement can help boost morale and encourage team members to contribute positively to the process.Code review is an essential part of the software development process.
